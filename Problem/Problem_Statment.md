# Database-Design-for-E-Commerce-Growth

### SQL Case Study

Problem Scenario : Greenspot Grocer is a (fictional) small, family-owned online grocery store that is growing rapidly and planning a major expansion. They are currently storing their product data in a spreadsheet format that has become unwieldy and will soon be unable to accommodate their growing inventory.  

They want you, as a back-end developer, to examine their current data and design a relational database that will be able provide the ability to organize and store current data, while providing scalability as the business expands its product offerings.  

## Solution:

#### Key features of the project include:

- Database Schema: Created seven related tables to handle product details, sales, purchases, inventory, and vendor information. The schema ensures data integrity and supports future scalability.
- Triggers: Implemented two triggers to automatically update the quantity_in_hand field in the inventory table upon each sale or purchase, ensuring real-time accuracy of stock levels.
- ER Diagram: Developed an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram illustrating the relationships between tables, providing a clear visualization of the database structure.
- Presentation: Prepared a comprehensive presentation to introduce the new database design to stakeholders, showcasing its benefits and functionalities.
